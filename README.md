# Note Taking Application

## About the Project:

This project is a note taking application. On the left portion of the application, the user can submit a title for the
note, a date, and the note itself. By clicking 'Save Note', the note is saved on a txt file that is attached on the 
project. On the right side of the application, it offers the user the option to look for specific note based on
titles/partial titles and dates. By clicking 'Search by Title/Search by Date', a list of notes that either matched the 
provided title or date will display in the 'Notes Found' section. If the user wishes to enlarge a specific note, then
they can select the note and click 'View Note'. A po- up message will display the note individually.
